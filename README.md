The files RSNA_Baseline contain the Pytorch Baseline for traning and inference. It is useful for a beginner.
The file RSNA_training_V0 contains the training code with a simple model (does not give a good score), and without using train_test_split from sklearn.
The file RSNA_training_V1 contains the training code with efficient model and using train_test_split from sklearn.
The file RSNA_training_V2 contains the training code with efficient model and with possibility of dividing data into folds.
